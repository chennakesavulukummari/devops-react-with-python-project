## 🔒 SECURITY CONTROLS IMPLEMENTED

### .gitignore Updated
```

✅ Credentials files blocked  
✅ AWS config blocked
✅ Terraform state files blocked
✅ Private keys blocked
✅ Deployment artifacts blocked
✅ 50+ security patterns added
```

### Sensitive File Patterns
```

✅ *-secret.md blocked
✅ *-password.md blocked
✅ *.pem, *.key blocked
✅ terraform.tfvars blocked
```

## 📊 VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Active Credentials Found
```
❌ AWS Access Keys: 0 (was 8, now redacted)
❌ AWS Secret Keys: 0 (was 7, now redacted)
❌ Gmail Passwords: 0 (was 2, now redacted)
❌ Database Credentials: 0
❌ API Keys: 0
❌ Tokens: 0
```

### Remaining Matches (All Safe)
```
✅ CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md - [REDACTED] references (historical)
✅ docs/SECURITY.md - Example format "(BAD)" (documentation)
✅ README.md - "your_aws_secret_key" placeholder (documentation)
✅ .claude/worktrees/ - Internal (git-ignored)
```

## ⚠️ NEXT STEPS (CRITICAL)

### 1. Rotate AWS Credentials Immediately
```bash
# Go to AWS IAM Console
# 1. Create new Access Key for svc-c3ops.io
# 2. Update ~/.aws/credentials
# 3. Delete exposed keys from IAM
# 4. Enable MFA on account
```

### 2. Verify Git History
```bash
# Check for credentials in git history
git log --all -p | grep -i "AKIA\|password" | head -20

# Should return NOTHING or only documentation references
```

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "security: Remove all exposed credentials and add SECURITY.md"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Security
- [ ] Enable branch protection
- [ ] Enable secret scanning
- [ ] Enable code scanning
